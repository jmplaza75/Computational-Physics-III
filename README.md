This course focuses on the key concepts of data analysis in the context of real-world physics datasets. The main objective is to equip students with the skills to efficiently analyze and interpret core physics data. While statistical principles are a part of the course, the emphasis is on their practical application. The module covers simulation techniques such as numerical integrators and Monte Carlo methods, and later transitions into machine learning methods applied to real-world data analysis.

You will learn:

- The core numerical tools to perform analysis of physical systems
- The thought process to take theoretical tools and apply them to practical problems
- The basic toolkit for any physics research internship or study
- Numerical Differential Equations
- Finite Approximations and Numerical Integrators
- Physics-Informed Machine Learning
- Multi-body Simulation
- Finite Element Simulation
- Monte Carlo
- Deep-Learning-Based Sampling Strategies
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Simulation-Based Inference/Likelihood-free Inference
- AI-Based Anomaly Detection
