So let's update our fit function to be even more sophisticated, to more closely model reality. In addition to the damping friction we had before, $\\left(F=-\\mu\\ell\\dot{\\theta}\\right)$, we can add a drag force $F\n", "=-k\\dot{\\theta}^2$. Let's go ahead and do that and see how our expanded function performs."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "40f22d5f", "metadata": {"tags": ["learner", "py", "learner_chopped", "lect_06"]}, "outputs": [], "source": ["#>>>RUN: L17.6-runcell07\n", "\n", "def ffull(y, t, g, l, mu, drag): #This is for ODE\n", "    theta, thetadot = y\n", "    return [thetadot, - (g / l) * np.sin(theta)-mu*thetadot-drag*thetadot**2 ]\n", "\n", "\n", "def func(t,x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6):\n", "    #solution = solve_ivp(ffull,[time[0],time[-1]], [x0, x1], max_step = 0.1, args=(x2,l,x3),t_eval=t)\n", "    #solution = x4*solution.y[0]+x5#np.sin(solution[:,0])+x[5]\n", "    solution = odeint(ffull, [x0,x1,], t, args=(x2,l,x3,x6))\n", "    solution = (x4*solution[:,0]+x5)\n", "    return solution\n", "\n", "\n", "xtest = np.array([-0.01,0.01,9.8,0.0,20,0.01,0.0,0])\n", "model = Model(func, independent_vars=['t'])\n", "params = model.make_params()\n", "params['x0']\n", "params['x0'].min=np.min(amp)\n", "params['x0'].max=np.max(amp)\n", "params['x1'].min=np.min(amp)*10\n", "params['x1'].max=np.max(amp)*10\n", "params['x2'].min=9.5\n", "params['x2'].max=10.0\n", "params['x3'].min=-0.1\n", "params['x3'].max=0.1\n", "params['x4'].min=1\n", "params['x4'].max=100\n", "params['x4'].vary=False\n", "params['x5'].min=-0.1\n", "params['x5'].max=0.1\n", "params['x6'].min=-10.5\n", "params['x6'].max=10.5\n", "#params['x7'].min=-0.1\n", "#params['x7'].max=0.1\n", "#params['x6'].vary=False\n", "\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "1bc80862", "metadata": {"scrolled": false, "tags": ["learner", "py", "learner_chopped", "lect_06"]}, "outputs": [], "source": ["#>>>RUN: L17.6-runcell08\n", "\n", "time=np.flip(tk)[0:10000][::10]\n", "amp= np.flip(ak)[0:10000][::10]\n", "weights=1/(np.ones(len(amp))*8*1e-4) #inflate uncertainty\n", "lk = 10.7886\n", "lj = 4.151\n", "l=lk\n", "xtest[4]=20\n", "params['x4'].vary=False\n", "result = model.fit(amp, t=time,params=params, weights=weights,\n", "                  x0=xtest[0],x1=xtest[1],x2=xtest[2],x3=xtest[3],x4=xtest[4],x5=xtest[5],x6=xtest[6])#,x7=xtest[7])\n", "print(result.fit_report())\n", "result.plot_fit()\n", "plt.show()\n", "result.plot_residuals()\n", "plt.show()\n", "\n", "time=np.flip(tj)[5000:10000][::10]\n", "amp= np.flip(aj)[5000:10000][::10]\n", "weights=1/(np.ones(len(amp))*8*1e-4) #inflate uncertainty\n", "lk = 10.7886\n", "lj = 4.151\n", "l=lj\n", "xtest[4]=20\n", "params['x4'].vary=False\n", "result = model.fit(amp, t=time,params=params, weights=weights,\n", "                  x0=xtest[0],x1=xtest[1],x2=xtest[2],x3=xtest[3],x4=xtest[4],x5=xtest[5],x6=xtest[6])#,x7=xtest[7])\n", "\n", "print(result.fit_report())\n", "result.plot_fit()\n", "plt.show()\n", "result.plot_residuals()\n", "plt.show()\n", "\n", "def gtrue(phi):\n", "    return 9.80616-0.025925*np.cos(2*phi)+0.000069*np.cos(phi)**2\n", "\n", "gtrue(42./180.*np.pi)\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "f4112140", "metadata": {"tags": ["learner", "md", "lect_06"]}, "source": ["Finally, let's look at our results for the best fit value of $g$.
