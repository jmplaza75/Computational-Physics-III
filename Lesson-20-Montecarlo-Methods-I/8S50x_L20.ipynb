To start with, let's consider a simple diffusion model. This works by considering a particle moving through some sort of fluid (i.e., a collection of other particles) with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in a specific direction. We assume that it will move a distance $\\ell$ and then scatter off one of the particles in the fluid. The scattering will cause the direction of the first particle's velocity to change in a random direction. The angular spread of the deflection depends on the velocity (or equivalently the average energy) of the particles in the fluid, which could be, for example, the atmosphere.\n", "\n", "To build a simple model, let's consider just Brownian motion, where we simulate each timestep and give the particle a random kick corresponding to a collision with a single other particle.

The scattering occurs from the fact that the proton is charged, and the nuclei of the atoms in the material are charged, and so we have Coulomb scattering (aka Rutherford scattering)of the proton from the nuclei. This is an elastic process that will inevitably spread the beam out in the transverse direction. Because of the very large mass difference, the collisions of protons with electrons (which is responsible for the energy loss) does not cause appreciable scattering. In contrast, the nuclei are much heavier than the proton so those collisions cause scattering but not much energy loss. The scattering angle is often written as:\n", "\n", "$$\n", "\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{13.6 \\rm MeV}{\\beta cp} z \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_{0}}}\\left(1+0.038\\log\\left(\\frac{xz^{2}}{X_{0}\\beta^{2}}\\right)\\right)\n", "$$\n", "\n", "where $z$ is the particle charge $X_{0}(z)$ is the electron density of the material, known as the radaition length, $\\beta$ is the velocity particles divided by the speed of light, $c$, $p$ is the momentum. Finally $x$ is the distance traversed. The more distance, the larger the scatter. Lastly, to get $X_{0}$ we will just use a formula. Suffice it to say its a function of the nuclear charge $Z$, I won't go into the details but you can read more about $X_{0}$ and the formula above <a href=\"https://pdg.lbl.gov/2022/reviews/rpp2022-rev-passage-particles-matter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>. \n", "\n", "We can simplify things since the actual properties of this scattering have been studied experimentally and the results can be fit with a parameterization containing the following two terms:\n", "\n", "$$\n", "\\Delta y = z_{1} \\Delta x \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{\\sqrt{12}} + \\frac{z_{2} \\Delta x\\sigma_{\\theta}}{2}\\\\\n", "\\Delta \\theta     = z_{2} \\sigma_{\\theta}\n", "$$\n", "\n", "where $\\Delta x$ is the distance traveled through the material, while $\\Delta y$ and $\\Delta \\theta$ are the y-scatter  of the beam in the transverse direction to its motion and the scatter of the angular deflection of the beam, respectively, The quantities $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are two normal randomly sampled distributions with $\\sigma=1$ that are independent of one another.\n", "\n", "Lets go ahead and plot these.

This is often how we try to characterize simulations. In the next lecture, we will do this by using deep learning to auto generate these profiles. What we will is something that is reasonably accurate, but almost 1000 times faster.
