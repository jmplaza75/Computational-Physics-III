However, we would really like to make a setup that can capture the dynamics for many thousands or millions of bodies, something that we could potentially use to model our galaxy. Of course, our galaxy has several orders of magnitude more stars than this.

The point being that, for stars that all have roughly the same velocity, the time updates will impact the local dynamics more strongly when $r$ is small compared to large $r$.
